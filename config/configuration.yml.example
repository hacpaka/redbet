  # Key used to encrypt sensitive data in the database (LDAP passwords).
  # If you don't want to enable data encryption, just leave it blank.
  # WARNING: losing/changing this key will make encrypted data unreadable.
  #
  # If you want to encrypt existing passwords in your database:
  # * set the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'
  #
  # If you have encrypted data and want to change this key, you have to:
  # * decrypt data using 'rake db:decrypt RAILS_ENV=production' first
  # * change the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'

  # Set this to false to disable plugins' assets mirroring on startup.

  # Your secret key for verifying cookie session data integrity. If you
  # change this key, all old sessions will become invalid! Make sure the
  # secret is at least 30 characters and all random, no regular words or
  # you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
  #
  # If you have a load-balancing Redmine cluster, you have to use the
  # same secret token on each machine.

  # Absolute path (e.g. /usr/bin/convert, c:/im/convert.exe) to
  # the ImageMagick's `convert` binary. Used to generate attachment thumbnails.
  #imagemagick_convert_command:

  # Configuration of MiniMagick font.
  #
  # Redmine uses MiniMagick in order to export a gantt chart to a PNG image.
  # This setting is necessary to properly display CJK (Chinese, Japanese,
  # and Korean) characters in the PNG image. Please make sure that the
  # specified font is installed in the Redmine server.
  #
  # This setting is necessary only when CJK characters are used in gantt.
  #
  # Note that rmagick_font_path in prior to Redmine 4.1.0 has been renamed
  # to minimagick_font_path.
  #
  # Examples for Japanese:
  #   Windows:
  #     minimagick_font_path: C:\windows\fonts\msgothic.ttc
  #   Linux:
  #     minimagick_font_path: /usr/share/fonts/ipa-mincho/ipam.ttf

  # URL of the avatar server
  #
  # By default, Redmine uses Gravatar as the avatar server for displaying
  # user icons. You can switch to another Gravatar-compatible server such
  # as Libravatar and opensource servers listed on
  # https://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/
  #
  # URL of each avatar is: #{avatar_server_url}/avatar/#{hash}
  #
  #avatar_server_url: https://www.gravatar.com        # default
